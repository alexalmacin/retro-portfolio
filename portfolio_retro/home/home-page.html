            <h1>I am Alex Almacin</h1>
            <p>I am a software developer with a degree in IT in Business Systems. I studied at Rosebank for 3 years before getting into the ABSA Software Developer program at CapaCiti. Technology in general has always interested me, enough to the point that I try to combine coding with my hobbies such as gaming and music. <br>
                Technology can be very interesting and it's because of that that I try to stay up to date with all things tech related. When I'm not coding, I browse Youtube to see any news reports or incidents that might've occured around the world. Aside from coding, I really love music and gaming. Every now and then I'll try creating a retro game with Python or any language that allows the creation of games. <br>
                I see myself as someone who is inquisitive and open minded to new and exciting things. During college I found an interest in software development and got to experience a bit of it during my first year. It was after my last year that I found CapaCiTi and started an 18 month program.
